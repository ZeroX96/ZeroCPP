# Preface: Cpp How To Program



#### Object-Oriented Programming: 

- **C++ Standard Library string.** 

  C++ offers two types of strings—<u>string</u> class objects and <u>C-style pointer-based strings</u>. its preferred to replace any occurrences of C strings with instances of C++ class string to make programs more robust and eliminate many of the security problems of C strings. 

- **Smart pointers.**

  Smart pointers help you avoid dynamic memory management errors by providing additional functionality beyond that of built-in pointers. such as `unique_ptr`, and `shared_ptr` and `weak_ptrin`.

- **C++ Standard Library array.** 

  C++ offers three types of arrays—arrays and vectors and C-style, pointer-based arrays.

- **Secure C++ Programming**
  It’s difficult to build industrial-strength systems that stand up to attacks from viruses, worms, and other forms of “malware”.  Today, via the Internet, such attacks can be instantaneous and global in scope. Building security into software from the beginning of the development cycle can greatly reduce vulnerabilities. The CERT® Coordination Center (www.cert.org) was created to analyze and respond promptly to attacks. **CERT—the Computer Emergency Response Team**—is a government-funded organization within the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute™. CERT publishes and promotes secure coding standards for various popular programming languages to help software developers implement industrial strength systems which avoid the programming practices that leave systems open to attacks.

  If you’ll be building industrial-strength C++ systems, consider reading Secure Coding in C
  and C++, Second Edition (Robert Seacord, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013).
